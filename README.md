# Hello World!🌎

### I'm Aditya Bajaj, an aspiring Software Developer.
                                                        
👨‍💻 I'm currently based in the US, working as a SDE at Amazon where I'm one of the core developers of the next-generation container execution data store for Sortation and Transportation technology which is built to sustain 10x growth in package volumes.

🎓 I have completed my Masters in Software Engineering at Arizona State University, USA, after completing my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, India.

✨ When I'm not thinking about tech, I'm probably playing Chess or the Piano, or probably reading some Jack Reacher novel.
