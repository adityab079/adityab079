# Hello World!🌎

#### I'm Aditya Bajaj, an aspiring Software Developer.

I'm currently based in the US, pursuing my Masters in Software Engineering at Arizona State University, Tempe, after having completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, India.




- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project - What Can I Do, which recently got accepted into Mozilla's Incubator Open Lab, for Startups.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my JavaScript skills(React, Angular & Vue). I'm also trying to improve my portfolio website.
- 📫 How to reach me: bajajaditya079@gmail.com or just visit my website https://adityab079.github.io/
- ✨ When I'm not thinking about tech, I'm probably playing Chess or the Piano, or probably reading some Jack Reacher novel.
