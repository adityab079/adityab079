# Hello World!ðŸŒŽ

### I'm Aditya Bajaj, an aspiring Software Developer.

I'm currently based in the US, pursuing my Masters in Software Engineering at Arizona State University, Tempe, after having completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, India.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 'What Can I Do' - a tool that helps you to collaborate with charitable organizations. It recently got accepted into Mozilla's Incubator Open Lab, for Startups.

- ðŸŒ± I'm also working on improving my JavaScript skills(React, Angular & Vue).

- âœ¨ When I'm not thinking about tech, I'm probably playing Chess or the Piano, or probably reading some Jack Reacher novel.
