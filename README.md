### Hello World!🌎

I'm Aditya Bajaj, an aspiring Software Developer, currently based in US.<br/>I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Software Engineering at Arizona State University, USA, after having completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, India.

I'm committed to maintaining cutting edge technical skills and am always looking for opportunities to leverage my developer skill sets. I demonstrate quick grasping power & strong work ethics, along with a good sense of responsibility and leadership in all of my work.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project - What Can I Do, which recently got accepted into Mozilla's Incubator Open Lab, for Startups.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack development & improving my JavaScript skills(React, Angular & Vue). I'm also trying to improve my portfolio website.
- 📫 How to reach me: bajajaditya079@gmail.com or just visit my website https://adityab079.github.io/
- ✨ When I'm not thinking about tech, I'm probably playing Chess or the Piano, or probably reading some Jack Reacher novel.
